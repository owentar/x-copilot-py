# xcopilot

This is Python plugin for [X-Plane](http://www.x-plane.com/) to support voice commands in the simulator.

## How does it work?

The process is quite simple:
1. Transcribe speech commands to text using [speech_recognition](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition) project.
2. When the command is in a string format, it's parsed through a regular expression to identify and extract the data from the specified command
3. Once the command is recognized, it's translated to data ref operations (setting / getting one or more data refs in x-plane)
